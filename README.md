Skzi: security requirements for cryptographic modules
=====================================================

What is Skzi?
-------------

Bcrypto/Skzi is a repo which supports development of a new version of STB 
34.101.27-2011 (security requirements for software cryptgraphic modules).

We are planning to upgrade STB in the following directions:

* Cover both hardware and software modules

* Introduce new security levels

* Introduce packets (optional groups of consolidated requirements)

* Revise the current security reqirements
